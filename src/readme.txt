Media information and help.

The media files included on this USB Drive can be played in your preferred media player.
content\mp3 contains .mp3 audio only files 
content\mp4 contains .mp4 video files

An HTML media player is also provided for you to view the content and play them without the need for any additional software.
Double clicking the 'player.html' file will open this player in your default web browser and allow you to browse and play the media files.

For best results, the recommended minimum screen size is 1024 x 768. If viewing the player in a browser window with a height of less than 720 pixels, the layout may not resize fully. Please increase the window size if this is an issue.

While this has been tested on a range of browsers and operating systems at the time of dispatch, we cannot guarantee this will work on any computer and we are unable to provide any support for the player.
Any future updates by third parties to their web browsers or any other computer software that reduce or stop the functionality of the player are beyond our control.
The functionality of the player does not prevent the purchased media files being played in any other software.
